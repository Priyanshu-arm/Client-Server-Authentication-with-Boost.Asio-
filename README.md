🔐 Client-Server Authentication with Boost.Asio (Phase 1)

As part of my ongoing exploration into systems and network programming, I built a minimal C++ client-server authentication system using the Boost.Asio library.
🚀 Objectives:

    Explore and understand Boost.Asio for asynchronous socket programming in C++

    Simulate a basic authentication flow between a client and server

    Build a foundational layer for secure communication in future phases

🧩 Tech Stack:

    Language: C++

    Library: Boost.Asio (header-only for portability)

    Development Platform: Ubuntu

    Tools: g++, nano, VS Code

📁 Phase 1 Functionality:

    Server binds to a TCP port and listens for client connections

    Client initiates a connection and sends a mock authentication request

    Server processes the request and sends a mock approval/denial response

    Used structured socket communication to simulate a real authentication protocol
